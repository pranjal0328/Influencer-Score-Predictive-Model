# Influencer-Score-Predictive-Model
### Our objective with this dataset is to build predictive models to predict an influencer's score using their follower count, engagement rate, and country of residence.The methodology we will be using is data exploration, preprocessing, model training/testing, and evaluation. We will begin by analyzing the dataset to understand the characteristics of the variables and the target variable (influencer score). We will perform data preprocessing such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Then we will split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on a subset of the data and evaluate its performance on unseen data. And lastly we will use appropriate evaluation metrics for regression tasks, such as Accuray, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve.
